fox
===

fox is a set of tools and utilities for building iOS and Mac projects. fox is not a normal project, but rather an outlet for my deep frustrations with Apple's Xcode tools. The vision for fox to provide a complete replacement for the Xcode build and project file system (but *not* an IDE or text editor.) I realize that achieving this vision is probably impossible, but I believe I'll get something positive out of the journey.
 
**fox is very early and not recommended for production use yet.**
